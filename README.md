Work is still in progress, so come back often to check out new articles and samples. My aim to to publish one article per week, until all feature of Dapper are covered.

### Notes

Samples are done using [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows), make sure you have installed it on your machine.
Samples also use SQL Server as database server. If you don't have a Windows machine, you can use the Docker version: [SQL Server 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017).
