### Notes

Samples are done using [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows), make sure you have installed it on your machine.
Samples also use SQL Server as database server. If you don't have a Windows machine, you can use the Docker version: [SQL Server 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017).
